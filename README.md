# Handwriting_Digit_Recognition

This project is basedon Python and Machine Learning application focused on building a logistic regression model to analyze and recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Weâ€™ll read over 70,000 input samples, visualize and analyze each digit, create our testing and training datasets, fit the logistic regression model and visualize the accuracy of our predictions with a confusion matrix!
